# tridentwar
Tridentwar is a Minigame inspired by Friends.

## History
The development of this Minigame originated on a Server a Friend of mine was hosting. 
The entire Idea of developing a game with tridents came up while we played around with all sorts of items including Tridents.
after a few weeks i came back to the idea and started designing a Plugin all around Tridents

## Updates
The Plugin receives Updates is i make them up. I am trying to say that this Plugin doesnt receive regular Updates because neither would i have enough resources both mind and timewise to make them up in a regular delay nor do i even want to this plugin is opensource so you are always free to just add your own thoughts to the plugin

## How to build
I developed the plugin with Intelij so for now i will only explain how to build it from Intelij  
make an artifact `file/artifact/new` you want to create an `empty jar`  
once you created the artifact drag the folder named tridentwar (it is in the same menu on the right side) into your jar (the section on the left)
save the artifact and return back to the editor itself there you have to open the menu point `build` and select `build artifact` you will get a little menu where intelij askes what exactly to do you want to click `build` in there  
the finished jar then will be in your projects root inside the newly generated `out` folder

## Supported version
I am using the most recent stable Minecraft Paper versions.
