# tridentwar
Tridentwar is a Minigame inspired by Friends.

## History
The development of this Minigame originated on a Server a Friend of mine was hosting. 
The entire Idea of developing a game with tridents came up while we played around with all sorts of items including Tridents.
after a few weeks i came back to the idea and started designing a Plugin all around Tridents

## Updates
The Plugin receives Updates as I make them up.   
I am trying to say that this Plugin won't receive regular updates because neither would I have enough resources both mind- and timewise to make them up in a regular delay nor do I even want to.  
The plugin is opensource, so you are always free to just add your Ideas to the plugin.  

## How to build
I developed the plugin with IntelliJ so for now I will only explain how to build it from IntelliJ.  
Make an artifact `file/artifact/new` you want to create an `empty jar`.  
Once you created the artifact, drag the folder named Tridentwar (it is in the same menu on the right side) into your jar (the section on the left).  
Save the artifact and return to the editor itself.
Now navigate to the menu point `build` and select `build artifact` you will get another little menu where IntelliJ askes what exactly to do you want to click `build` there.  
The finished jar then will be in your `project's root` inside the newly generated `out` folder.

## Supported version
I am using the most recent stable Minecraft Paper versions.
