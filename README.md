# tridentwar
Tridentwar is a minigame inspired by friends.

## History
The development of this plugin originated on a server, a friend of mine hosted, where we played around with all sorts of items.
I later took the idea and started designing a plugin all around it.

## Supported version
I am using the most recent stable Minecraft spigot versions and cannot guarantee downwards compatibility.

## License
You are free to use this plugin on your server but, you have to mention me as the author and have to keep credit notices I placed inside the plugin.

## Current Roadmap
Because this plugin currently is in its early development phase I will update this to more interesting features down the road  
my main goal, for now, is to get a stable plugin to host on servers without issues.
